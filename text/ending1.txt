As you swipe your personal keycard next to the reader in the elevator, you select the floor 0.
The entrance and the exit, final destination and the beginning of the journey.
While the doors slowly close you take a look in the mirror in front of you.
You see a young man dressed quite extravagantly, with very short hair and neatly trimmed black beard.
You feel neither disgust or happiness with this picture.
Supposedly you’ve always been like that - but this time there is no ego altering your perception.
You are who you are. A man free of memories as well as free to choose as he wishes.
While the elevator is slowly approaching the exit you wonder if this memory loss wasn’t a blessing in
disguise - of course, if you retained some of the past and had a sizable gap the identity
crisis would’ve been terrifying.
But you don’t remember so much that nothing really matters at this point - you are a blank slate, tabula rasa.
Even though you feel slight nervousness in your current position there is also some excitement to be found for sure.
Not everyone gets a fresh new start in their life after all. The doors open, you slowly walk through the hallway in
the direction of the exit. The steps echo through the empty corridor as you steadily make your way.
You feel a warm shine of sun on your cheek and get this visceral feeling of slight pleasure.
Little things, they are the ones responsible for happiness. You take out your personal keycard and take a look at it
once again -

JOHN DOE; FLOOR 4: APT 1; BLOK HOUSING MANAGEMENT;

As you finally walk outside you take a look at the street - there are some children playing in the park,
an elderly pair buying groceries from the vendor. Peace, nothing out of the ordinary.
You take the last look at the photo on the keycard and toss it in the garbage can. You are a free man.

Breathe in, breathe out - walk forward, never look back.
