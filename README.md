_The plan:_
- alone in an abandoned building, wakig up after drug induced coma, cant remember shit
- epxloring rooms and finding things on floor or in containers that rebuild the memory of the guy
- needs facemask to leave
- keycard to access lift
- top floor start, lift needed as stairs collapsed.
- switch on power in locked room, have to find key
- enter room, lists doors going into other rooms, user chooses room
- crackhead npc talking bollocks with real speech,  but could end up saying something useful
- note that contains code to safe with keycard in

**items to find** _These should induce some sort of memory_
1. keycard for lift (end of game)
2. fork jamming paper in building, note in his writing saying "get out of building"
3. facemask (cant leave without one)
4. wallet
5. picture of family
6. ID 
7. lots of baggys
8. keys for the mains power room

**key stages in the game**
1. sees stairs has collapsed
2. sees elevator but no power
3. finds room with power symbol on door, but locked
4. key found in container in room
--- more to be added (anyone feel free to add)

**TODO**
 - Changing capitalisation of menu
 - change blok4 note to logo
 - change text folder to "text"
 - Oscar - Implement more items and containers
 - Tayeeb - break the game, with steps
 
 one of the endings is that a secret special keycard is found, 
 and that keycard allows lift to go to floor 20 and finish game
