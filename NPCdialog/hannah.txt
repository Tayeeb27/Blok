Hannah: Well, look who decided to finally show up.
You: What are you talking about?
Hannah: Don't pretend that you forgot about what happened last night.
You: I genuinely can't recall what happened yesterday - nothing about you and me at least?
Hannah: Well, that seems to say a lot - we're done.
You: What do you mean?
Hannah: Oh you know very well what that means - it's over, nada. Get out.
You: Okay, whatever the fuck do you mean - I just want to get my shit and get out of the building.
Hannah: Fine. You left your coat, wallet and ID card in this room. Get whatever the hell you want and consider yourself out...
