Magpie: Shit man, I think I know what caused you to lose your memories.
You: Something in the vial?
Magpie: Yeah, its called Neurosis - good stuff, but with some nasty side effects. God, I'm so sorry man - shouldn't have sold it to you that night.
You: What do you mean?
Magpie: Neurosis usually only has a very small probability of side effects when taken while sober. But when mixed with alcohol its a nasty one.
Magpie: And it seems to really have done a number on you.
You: Why the fuck would you sell it to me when i was drunk?
Magpie: You were insisting I sell you the strongest stuff I have.
You: Is there any way to get my memory back?
Magpie: I would recommend seeing a therapist, there's one on floor 4 actually...
You: Jesus christ, maybe I will.
Magpie: Sorry again...
