Peter: Yo you alright? You don't look too good...
You: Not feeling too good. Cant remember a thing. Do we know each other?
Peter: Please tell me you're joking. You don't remember me?
You: No no, I'm being serious. The last thing I remember is waking up this morning feeling like shit.
Peter: That shit really fucked you up last night. I think it will be best if you go watch CCTV recordings from last night.
You: Damn, okay... How much did I drink last night?
Peter: You did more than just drink. Go and ask that weird guy in room 2 what he gave you last night.
Peter: Anyway, have you spoken to Hannah yet?
You: No, who's Hannah?
Peter: Dude what?? She's your girlfriend. Well she was, but I wouldn't be surprised if she's done with your shit after last night.
Peter: Oh and before I forget, you left your trousers and work ID in here last night.
You: I'm not even gonna ask why...
You: Sorry for everything.
Peter: It's fine, I hope you get your memory back soon.
You: One last question - How do I get out of here? The elevator doesnt allow me to go to the ground floor.
Peter: You need your personal key card to get to the ground floor or floor 4.
You: I'll have a look around for it then, thanks. Bye.
